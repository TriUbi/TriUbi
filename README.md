- 👋 Hi, I’m @TriUbi but you can call me Trini.
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming the best version of myself: personal growth, healthy eating, going to the gym, singing, writing, and coding are my passions.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning and love improving my skills. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on high-potential projects, in an environment where everyone is hungry for growth, impact, and innovation. 
- 📫 You can reach me at my personal email: triubilla@gmail.com. Check out my links on my profile! 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m both a writer and a programmer, combining my two greatest passions.
